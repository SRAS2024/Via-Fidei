        Via Fidei Admin React app mounts here.

        This screen mirrors the public home layout:
        - Seasonal banner across the top with cross, Holy Family, or crucifix.
        - Centered Via Fidei title and subtitle.
        - Same navigation tabs as the main site.
        - Account and Settings controls on the right, plus an Admin indicator.

        When the browser path is /admin, the React shell renders the Admin view:
        - Mission and About text editors.
        - Notices editor that controls the "Notices" section at the top of Home.
        - Seasonal banner theme selector for Normal, Advent, and Easter.
        - Collage upload with "Take Photo, Photo Library, Files" where supported.
          Images are saved through the backend and shown at the bottom of Home.
        - Admin login and logout, returning to the standard Home view after logout.

        All admin changes are saved through the API and propagate to the Home
        screen for all visitors as soon as they are stored.
